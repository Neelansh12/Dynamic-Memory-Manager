# Dynamic-Memory-Manager


An interactive and fully-featured web-based visualizer for understanding memory management techniques like **FIFO** and **LRU** page replacement algorithms.

This is a standalone single HTML file — just open it in your browser and get started! 🖥️✨

## Features ✅

- **FIFO and LRU Algorithms:** Visualize how pages are managed in memory.
- **Step-by-Step Mode:** Pause and go through each step manually.
- **Animation Speed Control:** Set your desired speed for auto mode.
- **Sound Effects:** Enjoy a sound cue for each memory operation.
- **Performance Chart:** Live hits vs. misses chart using Chart.js.
- **Progress Bar:** Track progress through your input reference string.
- **Export Logs as PDF:** Download your simulation log for study or reporting.
- **Responsive Design:** Works on desktop and mobile devices.

## How to Use 📖

1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.
2. Enter your **Page Reference String** (e.g., `7 0 1 2 0 3 0 4 2 3 0 3 2`).
3. Set the **Frame Size** (number of memory frames).
4. Choose your desired **Speed** in milliseconds.
5. Select **Mode:**
   - `Auto` — Automatically runs through the reference string.
   - `Step-by-Step` — Manual control using "Next Step" button.
6. Click:
   - **Run FIFO** to simulate First-In-First-Out algorithm.
   - **Run LRU** to simulate Least Recently Used algorithm.
7. Watch the simulation and observe:
   - Memory frames update.
   - Progress bar advance.
   - Chart updates live.
8. When done, click **Export Log to PDF** to save your results!

## Technologies Used 🛠️

- **HTML + CSS + JavaScript** (Vanilla, no frameworks)
- **Chart.js** — for live performance chart.
- **jsPDF** — for exporting logs to PDF.
- **Audio** — sound effects for better engagement.,

## Installation ⚙️

No installation required!  
Simply download and open the HTML file in your browser.

Alternatively, you can deploy it online on platforms like GitHub Pages or Netlify for easy access.

## Roadmap 🧭

- [ ] Add support for additional algorithms (Optimal, Clock, etc.)
- [ ] Add dark/light mode toggle.
- [ ] Improve mobile responsiveness.
- [ ] Add localStorage support to save simulations.
